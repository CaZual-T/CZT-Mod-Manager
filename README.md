    - If you use Win EDU or Enterprise you may have an error appear, just ignore, restart app, then click auto detect.
    - If you already have winrar installed it MIGHT piggyback off of it (which is fine). Not 100% sure though.
    - Unrar is the cli version of winrar. (https://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm)
    
### - Click Auto Detect (this sets the source and tool path)
### - Select Game profile
### - Drag desired mods to the logbox in the app (they can be extracted already or still be zip, 7z or rar. CZT will handle it all)

### - Launch Game.
- You only have to launch with CZT when you initially setup, and when you want to toggle them on or off, once toggled on they will stay enabled until you toggle off.

# Features:
- Multi game profiles
- Smart extraction (can handle zip, 7z, rar, and even already extracted mods)
- Compatible with community mod loaders like melon loader for schedule 1.
- Launch with or without mods (useful for games like RoN that block PC players from joining console players due to mods being installed)
- Auto Detect Paths for Source, Tool, and Selected Profile. (please let me know if any of these fail)
- Buttons to browse all location of mods, source folder, game folder, and unrar install.
- Will overwrite mods of the same name (makes it easy for updating!)
