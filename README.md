Currently Supports Ready or Not, Schedule I, and Dying Light 2. More to be added!

# Features:
- Multi game profiles
- Smart extraction (can handle zip, 7z, rar, and even already extracted mods)
- Compatible with community mod loaders like melon loader for schedule 1.
- Launch with or without mods (useful for games like RoN that block PC players from joining console players due to mods being installed)
- Auto Detect Paths for Source, Tool, and Selected Profile. (please let me know if any of these fail)
- Buttons to browse all location of mods, source folder, game folder, and unrar install.
- Will overwrite mods of the same name (makes it easy for updating!)

# CZT Mod Manager Setup:
### - 1:) Download and Run installer <https://github.com/CaZual-T/CZT-Mod-Manager/releases>
<img width="174" height="41" alt="{7EB16B48-08C8-4FFD-98D0-5B2268A55CE7}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7a5422c-d50a-44f9-9d7d-f1647d57bca0" />

### - 2:) Click Create Root (Select Drive, this will be where your mods are stored.)

### - 3:) Install Unrar (click the button top right) (FOLLOW ON SCREEN PROMPTS)
- YOU MUST INSTALL TO > Drive_selected_in_step_2/CZT Mod Installer/czt_tools/unrar.exe
<img width="160" height="184" alt="{673739FC-5BBF-4132-939A-5967EE68D8AC}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6b682d5-245c-4ddc-a44b-30763fdeae2b" />

    - If you use Win EDU or Enterprise you may have an error appear, just ignore, restart app, then click create root again and select the drive you originally chose.
    - If you already have winrar installed it MIGHT piggyback off of it (which is fine). Not 100% sure though.
    - Unrar is the cli version of winrar. (https://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm)
    
### - 4:) Select Game profile
