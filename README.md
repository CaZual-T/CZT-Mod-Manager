Currently Supports Ready or Not, Schedule I, Dying Light 2, and Dying Light The Beast. More to be added!

# Features:
- Multiple game profiles.
- Works on ANY drive.
- Merge mods (Dying Light Games)
- Smart extraction (can handle zip, 7z, rar, and even already extracted mods)
- Compatible with community mod loaders like melon loader for schedule 1.
- Launch with or without mods (useful for games like RoN that block PC players from joining console players due to mods being installed)
- Auto Detect Paths for Source, Tool, and Selected Profile. (please let me know if any of these fail)
- Buttons to browse all location of mods, source folder, game folder, and unrar install.
- Will overwrite mods of the same name (makes it easy for updating!)
