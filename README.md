  - This is where your config and mod files will be stored. 'SelectedDrive:\CZT Mod Manager\' </br>
> [!NOTE]
> You wont be able to save any custom settings until you create root.

### 3:) Install/Set Unrar 
- Click "Install Unrar"
  - or download from: https://www.rarlab.com/rar/unrarw64.exe and place it in /CZT Mod Manager/czt_tools/unrar.exe
- Click browse when the installer popup appears.</br>
  - Install to > /CZT Mod Manager/czt_tools/unrar.exe</br>
    - Right now you have to do it this way.
    - I meant to set it up so you could set a path to winrar if you already had that installed,
    - but i guess i fuckered it all up so it only works if unrar is in the czt_tools folder.
    - Sorry about that. (ill fix it soon)
- You can click 'Install UnRar' again to rescan and set its path automatically.
  - Or click set path (again it HAS to be to /CZT Mod Manager/czt_tools/unrar.exe)

### 4:) Retrieve and save your NEXUS API key 
- Why? This is how CZT communicates with the nexus website to retrieve mod info.
- Go to <https://next.nexusmods.com/settings/api-keys>
- Scroll to the bottom to get your personal key.</br>
- CZT uses the api to simply fetch mod data such as thumbnail, creator name, mod name and current version.</br>
  - all of this gets displayed within the gui.</br>

### 5:) Select Game profile
- Select an option from the drop down on the left.  (you can change this at any time)
- Choose pathing mode (It's set to steam 'auto' by default)
- Click DETECT STEAM.
  - Alternatively you can use manual pathing and follow the instructions in the log box.

# How to install mods:
### 1:) Select Game Profile in the MAIN tab then...
- Drag & Drop your mods to anywhere within the log box on the Main Menu tab. (.zip, .rar, .7z, or Raw Files/Folders)
  - Most mods do not need extracted before install. (CZT handles extraction)
    - Extract folder based mods to desktop and drag the raw folder into CZT if you experience double foldering issues.
  - Mods with a _mod_info.json file attached will automatically have their mod info updated in the manage tab.
    - Image, Mod Name, Creator, Install Date, Version, Nexus URL (ID)

# Common errors w/ solutions:
### TO AVOID HAVING TO RESTART THE APP BETWEEN MAJOR FUNCTIONS. ENABLE DEVELOPER MODE.
- (Windows) Settings > Advanced > For Developers (Toggle Developer Mode On)
  - This allows symlinks to be created without admin permissions.
  - 99% of errors are solved by enabling this.

### IF you chose to not enable developer mode, Run CZT as ADMIN if you encounter the following errors:
- "[ERROR] No write permission to drive"
- "[ERROR] Permission denied: ':\czt_write_test.tmp'."
- "[ERROR] A required privilege is not held by the client"

### Q: Why does czt need write permissions?
A: This is so CZT can create required folders and properly edit the profile_mods_list.json (file that contains all your mod info)

### Q: Why does CZT need admin permissions when launching my game?
A: Not all, but some users may need to launch their game with CZT as admin to ensure symlinking works correctly.

### "I cant drag and drop downloaded mods into CZT"
- Don't run CZT as admin when installing mods.
- Its IMPOSSIBLE for windows explorer to move files to an app with higher permissions. This is a windows limitation.﻿

- If you are already in the manage tab at the time of merge you will not see data7 until you reload the ui.mod list. </br>
  - You can do this by simply switching to any other tab then going back to the manage tab.
